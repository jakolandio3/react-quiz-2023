React Quiz SPA 2023 - Jakob Douglas

QUICK START (for development);
(1) npm i (install dependencies)
(2) npm run server (run json server for fake API)
(3) npm start (start react app with hot reload)
(4) open a new window in your browser to http://localhost:3000 (should open on run start)

# Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## 'npm run server'

Starts the json server on http://localhost:8000 so the application can use the data as a 'fake API'
